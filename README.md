# Quantum_Dot_Donor
This project involved large matrix manipulation to model quantum systems. Through modelling different mathematical processes like convolution and other linear algebra, different matricies for the quantum systems were produced. These could then be plotted and developed in subsequent stages. 

The required Python libraries for this python project were: numpy, scipy, matplotlib
